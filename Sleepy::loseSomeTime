  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = 17;    //orange led on micro 32u4

#include <JeeLib.h>

    ISR(WDT_vect) { Sleepy::watchdogEvent(); }

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {

  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED OFF (HIGH is the voltage level)
  Sleepy::loseSomeTime(2000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED ON by making the voltage LOW
  Sleepy::loseSomeTime(500);              // wait for a 1/10 second
}
